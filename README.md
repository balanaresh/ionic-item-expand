Ionic Item Expand
===================

Nifty Modal is a set of additional CSS classes to be used to animate your ionic modal box. Out of the box, ionic provides one CSS class ('slide-in-up') as the default behavior of the modal.
The set of included classes are sourced from [Nifty Modal](https://github.com/codrops/ModalWindowEffects) and [bounce.js](https://github.com/tictail/bounce.js).
The animations are not just limited to the modal and can be reused for other components in your application.
